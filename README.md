# MagicCowGamesFiles

A repository to host special files that will be used by multiple services and games that Magic Cow Games relies on such as the Wizard's Death Wish's web server.

The resources will be obtained through GET requests to GitHub, allowing the underlying resources to change without having to modify game code.

Services that can make use of this system are:
* Wizard's Death Wish's web server
* Custom in-game MOTD screens
